Both Data Science (DS) and Operations Research (OR) are two disciplines that provide advanced analytics capabilities. They are highly relevant and overlapped, but they work in two different paradigms. In this post, I'm trying to explain the relationship between DS and OR, the differences, and how they could work together in advanced analytics based on my experience in DS and OR.

Let's get started with the description of DS and OR.


## What are DS and OR?

**Data Science (DS)** has become a popular buzzy word since 2011. Here is the definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science):
> DS  is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning, and big data.

From the above definition, we can see that DS is a mixture study of maths/statistics, computer science, and an understanding of business problems. DS uses **statistics**, **data mining**,  and **machine learning** to extract knowledge and insights from data to inform, direct, and predict business. As its name indicates, DS starts from the data, usually big data.
