## What is Classification Problem

## Select Performance Criteria
For classification problems in ML, you want to minimize the False Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they don't) and maximize the True Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they do).

### Confusion Matrix

### Accuracy

### Precision

### Recall

### F-Score

### ROC Curves
