## What is Classification Problem


Now that you have your initial features selected, you are now ready to create your first ML model in BigQuery.

There are several model types to choose from:

Forecasting numeric values like next month's sales with Linear Regression (linear_reg).
Binary or Multiclass Classification like spam or not spam email by using Logistic Regression (logistic_reg).
k-Means Clustering for when you want unsupervised learning for exploration (kmeans).


## Select Performance Criteria
For classification problems in ML, you want to minimize the False Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they don't) and maximize the True Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they do).

### Confusion Matrix

### Accuracy

### Precision

### Recall

### F-Score

### log_loss

### ROC Curves
