In my previous post I described how to a Linux Virtual Machine(VM) and connect to it through WindSCP on Windows 10 under a company proxy. However, it is not the best practice from security perspective. The best practice is to create a VM with private IP only and the private IP can come from a dedicated Virtual Network that can be in different Resource Group
