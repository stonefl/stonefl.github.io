2020 is over, and brighter days are coming in 2021. On the last day of 2020, I want to reflect on the past year and setup some goals for the new year. The COVID-19 changed our lives and caused many losses, but I was, luckily enough, able to get on some new habits, chanllenges, and achievements in 2020.

# Reflections on 2020

- **Enjoyed staying more with family**: I have been working from home since the late of March. At the very beginning, I worried my two screaming little girls would ruin my work at home. It turned out that I was completely wrong. They know when they cann't disrupt me and when they can ask me to play games with them. To be honest, I have got used to working from home and I'm really enjoying the time staying with my family at home.

- **Learned about cloud skills**: Cloud computing is the key to the future industries. I feel lucky to have chances to learn about both Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, who are the two of the top public cloud providers in the world. I have successfully obtained three GCP certificates at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020.

- **Started a manager role**: I got started a new role of Manager Operations Research at FedEx Freight on Sep. 16th. The quote from Steve Jobs below might be the best reason why I would move from a technical person to a manager. While it is challenging, I'm learning to be a good manager.

> "They are the great individual contributors who never, ever want to be a manager... But decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as them."

- **Started new good habits**: Started with working from home, I have been getting up at 5am and running everyday. Running distance started from 0.7 miles increased to 3.5 miles now. I have reached total 250 miles goal!

- **Read books**: I have finsihed 10 English and 15 Chinses books, covering history, business, management, computer, big data, productivity and time management. I will take time to do a review on some of the great ones.

- **Wrote blogs**: I'm not a blogger, but I like to write down what I have learned in a logging way. I have finished 7 tech blogs on GCP, Azure and Power BI. Welcome to check them out:

# Resolutions for 2021

- **To be a better manager**: keep learning and improving.
- **Get threee Certificates of Azure**: Data Scientist, Administrator, and Solution Architect
- **Read more books**: at least one book per month. And review some of the good ones.
- **Write more blogs**: at least one blog per month. Not only focus on techniques, but also on management. 
- **Run more miles**: reach total 1000 miles by the end of 2021. 
- **Spend less time on political medium and news**. Yes, I think political medium and news are not good for health, neither physical nor mental.
- **Take a long vacation for a long trip with family**: This is what I owe to my daughters.
