Have you ever got stumped by a logic puzzle? Sukodu got you scratching your head? Einstein’s puzzle made you crazy with the clues and facts? These puzzles might seem like mental gymnastics, but there’s a secret weapon can be used to crack the code: Constraint Programming (CP).

## What Makes CP Special?
CP has emerged as a powerful paradigm within Operation Research, offering a unique approach using logic and constraints to find elegant solutions to complex optimization problems. Drawing inspiration from Computer Science fields like Logic Programming, Graph Theory, and Artificial Intelligence, CP becomes a powerful tool for optimization problems in various fields.

Both CP and traditional Mathematical Programming (MP) deal with decision variables, constraints, and/or objective functions. But CP stands out with a few key features:

- **Intuitive Modeling Language**: CP utilizes a flexible and natural language-like approach to model problems. This allows for the inclusion of virtually any expression over the variables, surpassing the limitations of MP in terms of:
- **Wide Variety of Decision Variables**: CP supports classical binary, integer, and continuous variables, but also introduces “structured” variable types like sets, activities, and intervals, ideal for scheduling and sequencing problems.
- **Diverse Constraint Expressions**: CP embraces a wider range of constraints, including arbitrary algebraic and logical expressions, “global constraints,” and even reasoning with meta-constraints.
- **Powerful Search Strategy**: CP employs a systematic search process to navigate the problem space. Starting with all possible value combinations, it progressively prunes inconsistent values based on the defined constraints. This search strategy, guided by various algorithms like depth-first or width-first search, efficiently explores the reduced search space to find feasible solutions.
- **Flexibility in Problem Formulation**: CP models can be categorized as Constraint Optimization Problems (COP) with an objective function or Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) without one. This flexibility allows for finding optimal solutions or simply confirming the existence of feasible solutions.
- **Combination with Other Frameworks**: CP’s ability to generate feasible solutions rapidly makes it valuable in conjunction with other optimization models and engines, such as implementing column generation in complex problems.

## Einstein’s Puzzle

Einstein’s puzzle is a brain teaser was claimed created by Albert Einstein, who claimed that 98% of population in the world could not figure it out.
